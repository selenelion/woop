---Ingredients/Materials---

-1 box of pseudo-ephedrine pills (sedated)
-1 Cold compress pack (Ammonia Nitrate)
-1 bottle of lye crystals
-2 AA Lithium Batteries (Energizer)
-Coleman Fuel (naptha)
-Muriatic or Sulfuric Acid
-Noniodized Salt
-Aluminum Foil
-2 20 oz bottles
-Coffee Filters
-A clear hose about to 6-12" long
-Funnel
-2 Pint Mason Jars
-Lineman Pliers

---Preparation---

1. First, make sure you are working in a  clean and safe area

2. Clean both of the 20 0z bottles with some paper towels and a clothes hanger, rinse with Coleman fuel and repeat. Repeat with mason jars.

3. Crush all pseudo-ephedrine pills into a fine grain

4. Crush the ammonium nitrate, as well.

---Procedure---

1. Use your funnel and one coffee filter to deposit 8 oz of Coleman fuel into one of your 20 oz bottles.

2. Using your Lineman pliers, strip lithium from your AA batteries, tear them into small balls and add them to your fuel.

3. Add 3 Teaspoons of Ammonium Nitrate from the cold compress pack and add 3 teaspoons of lye crystals as well.

4. Seal the bottle and shake in order to initiate the reaction.

5. Open the bottle very slowly and carefully, oxygen entering the bottle too fast could initiate an explosive reaction. Add your pseudo-ephedrine and let it cook for 45 minutes to an hour. Burp the bottle when it gets tight and avoid shaking the bottle in the last 15 minutes of the cook.

6. Their should be a good amount of copper floating with your lithium strips. This is a sign that your reaction is near complete.

7. Put 3-4 Coffee filters over one of the mason jars and pour cooked mixture through the filter. Discard the filtered lithium.

***WEAR MASK FROM THIS POINT ON***

8. In order to proceed, a gassing bottle must be created. The process of gassing consists of hitting the mixture with HCl causing the mixture to crystalize and fall to the bottom of the jar. In order to create this, clean your other 20 oz bottle and make hole in the cap big enough for your hose.

9. If using Sulfuric Acid, add 1 tablespoon of salt to the bottle and just a couple of drops of sulfuric acid. If using Muriatic Acid, add 5 soda tabs to bottle and a couple of drops of acid.

10. Put the hose right above the mixture in your mason jar and squeeze the bottle in order to gas the mixture. The methamphetamine should crystalize and fall to the bottom of the jar.

11. Hit it with smoke a couple of times and stir it until no methamphetamine drops anymore.

12. Filter the mixture into the other mason jar and retrieve the end product.
